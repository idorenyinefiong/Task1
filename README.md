*****Summary of the video - Git and Github crash course for beginners*****

This is a tutorial video that illustrates practically the basics of git and github. 
Git is a version control system for tracking change in computer files, it is a decentralised or distributed version control system whuch means that many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network. It sores files of every kind, allowing taking snapshots of the files at any point (commits) which a user can also make reference to them. The course is a complete guide on working on git and github using both the gitbash and the code editor showing steps on creating a git repository, adding files to it, making a commit, removing files and also pushing files and making pull requests using the basic git commands like "git init" for initializing a local git repository, "git add" for adding files to the index, "git status" to check the status of a working tree, "git commit" used to commit changes to index, "git push" for pushing to remote repository, "git pull" for pulling latest from remote repository and "git clone" to clone repository into a new directory. Git has proven to be a very powerful and important resource for developers because of its numerous advantages especially the safe keeping of files.
