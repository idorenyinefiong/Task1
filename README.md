*****Summary of the video - Git and Github crash course for beginners*****

This is a tutorial video that illustrates practically the basics of git and github. 
Git is a version control system for tracking change in computer files, it is a decentralised or distributed version control system whuch means that many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network. It stores files of every kind, allowing taking snapshots of the files at any point (commits) which a user can also make reference to them. The course is a complete guide on working on git and github using both the gitbash and the code editor showing steps on creating a git repository, adding files to it, making a commit, removing files and also pushing files and making pull requests using the basic git commands.
